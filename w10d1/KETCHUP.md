# Catch up!

## What did you think of the Rails week

- Rails is fine
- Got better when more comfortable with MVC
- Jungle tasks satisfying to complete
- Happy no lecture
- Sad no lecture
- More basic Ruby lectures (breakouts maybe)


## What is still mystifying ?

- MVC ?
- Installing a fresh project
- Namespacing
- What is generated vs what is not
- Generators
- ORM


MVC ?

Model View Controller

Model: Representation of a concept, properties, how it is stored (DB)
Controller: Actions that you can do on a model
View: A way to see the model data, or a way to interact with the model
